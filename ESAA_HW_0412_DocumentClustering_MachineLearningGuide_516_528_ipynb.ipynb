comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n133

                                                                                                                                The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55



The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

  The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

different room .\\n63

                                                                                                                         Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle

                                                        The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n133

and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46

only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

.\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

  The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

different room .\\n63

                                                                                                                         Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

                                    I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle

                                                        The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

                      After reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n2                                                   I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n3

time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n5

owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .\\n7

will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .\\n16

like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .\\n20

the 5, way button is a major improvement .\\n21

to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n23

the edges, the pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .\\n25                                                                                                                                              Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .\\n26

buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27

.\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                              It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .\\n29

get work done .\\n30                                                                                                                                      if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

                                             With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n33

manageable size and are a lot less sensitive .\\n34

                      It took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A button click brings up the dictionary, starting with that entry .\\n38

isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

                                   Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page

appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44

buttons many times .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                               The text is darker and clearer and the buttons are more like the Sony , ,  both on one side   .\\n46

                                            Each time this has happened, I have contacted the support team, each time the team member has made me delete the book from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .\\n53

 I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .\\n57

longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n59

the home button by accident a lot .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61

the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                            However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n63

button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65

                                          Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67

   Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73

myself using this feature too much, but it's a lot better than nothing when you need both hands free, and it would be a truly fantastic feature for anyone with poor eyesight or blindness .\\n20

easy on the eyes, I like it better than an actual book .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                      0 out of 5 stars A great tool for those of us with aging eyes, February 28, 2009\\n25                                                   The text, bumped up two magnification levels, is sharp and clear enough for me to make out, and while I've seen some criticism of the gray page background, I actually find it easier on my eyes than stark white .\\n26                                                                 For those of us in the Boomer bulge whose eyesight is failing and taking with it the pleasure of reading ,  and for those with other forms of visual impairment ,  it's nothing less than a miracle .\\n27                                                                                                                                         As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .\\n28

                                                                                                                                             I have been keeping an eye on the Kindle since the first was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                    and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .\\n31

center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .\\n33                                                                                                                                            Even without the back light, within fifteen minutes of reading on the sony reader due to the glare, my eyes were hurting .\\n34

distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                      Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .\\n37                                                                                                           And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                 First of all, the Kindle 2 is very easy on the eyes .\\n39                                                                                 Some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but I find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .\\n40                                                                                                                                  A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .\\n41                                                                                                        I won't be using the feature much anyway because I get a lot more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .\\n42

                                                                                                                                               Not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .\\n48                                                                                                                           With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .\\n49

taxes the eyes, and allows me to shift some of my time away from the computer for blogs that I would normally read online .\\n52

can still get a good price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .\\n2    Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3

                                                                                                                                                    I would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read for myself with 20 20 vision and especially for the low, vision reader .\\n17

did see a few big price differences eg .\\n18

                                                                                                                                                                        Book prices are less than you will find in book stores and may be less than you will find on other e, book sites .\\n20

price ?\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                 since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25

alternative .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29                                                                                                                                                                               As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30

Disappointing given the prices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure

prices at a bookstore .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I would love a case cover that's well made and doesn't cost a third the price of the device .\\n91

counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38



                                           The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

                Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n57

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n19                                                                                                                                              Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20

             There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

           You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road

                                                             The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer

and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25                                                                                                                          I'd highly

                                                 You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                                                           I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

   Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into

                                                The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93

road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

            Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104

                 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature,

great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !\\n53

                                                                                                                              It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6,

getting 5 mpg less then 06 Accord .\\n132

                                                              So far not super impressed with gas mileage, and comfort, well lets just say my dealership just ordered a new seat cushion for me today

                                                       The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n5

.\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8

found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .\\n9

whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12

get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

computer, going to the site, printing the directions .\\n14

of paper .\\n15

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Saves mobile phone minutes, because you don't have to call and ask for directions .\\n17

would expect from a Garmin, and less intrusive than on some other brands .\\n18

intersect, the GPS unit will give you directions to that intersection .\\n27

directions to that location .\\n28

                                       If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .\\n30

                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n31

               Some of the verbal directions :\\n32                                                                                                                                                                        It should tell me to take the Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions seemed to focus on Interstate travel and I have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\n35

apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .\\n36

easy to see and understand .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40

by, turn directions are clear and very timely .\\n41   My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            button, and it gave us directions right to Carmel .\\n45

directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46

                                                                                                                                                            It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54

distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a

                                                     My daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57

directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

                  I would have struggled to find with my usual combination of maps and Web, based directions .\\n72

were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .\\n73

remote areas of ME .\\n74

problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76

directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77

               And, it's nice that the Garmin tells you that, at your current speed, you'll reach your destination in 43 minutes .\\n23

travelling on, and your actual speed .\\n24                                                                                                                     I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n25

particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                          It was fun to know where you are and the speed that you are going and the time you will be there .\\n27

            I have observed several cases on an interstate where the 255W required driving well over the speed limit in order to achieve the initial arrival estimate .\\n29                                                                                                                                                         The city routes were somewhat closer but they could not have actually been faster because of the numerous traffic lights and slower driving speed .\\n30

limits on major roads, and it notes your average and max speed on your current trip .\\n32

               Lastly  , you can immediately see the speed limit for every road you are on .\\n34

the estimated time of arrival feature that recalibrates itself automatically based on your travel speed .\\n36

territory .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                               I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n38                    I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The road I live off of, the speed limit is 45, the GPS says that the speed limit is 50 .\\n40

but dead on in other places .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n42                                                                                                                      The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n43                                                                                 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n44

it shows my speed and the posted speed limit .\\n45

for this one feature I leave the unit on even if it is not navigating to a set location .\\n55

have some errors in its internal map .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                    Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .\\n27

found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n29

                  Because the accuracy is good to the street address level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n33

then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    The closest one that gives the most accurate route that I usually take is the Navigon .\\n40                                                                                                                          After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                    It has worked well

                                   What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy

standard keyboard is no problem for me to use, , and I'm a touch typist, , the keys themselves are a good size and feel good .\\n10

                                          The keyboard is terrific, solid feel and full size .\\n11

    It's the perfect size and weight to take almost anywhere .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                             The machine has the most comfortable small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .\\n13   It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n14



      The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .\\n25

size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped\\n26

bulky size .\\n27

size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n31

DOWN arrows, but I suppose that was probably unavoidable .\\n32

.\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It runs quietly and operates Windows efficiently, staying incredibly cool compared to the instant burn, your, lap sauna of my full, sized HP Pavillion .\\n35

despite the Atom this is much faster than a full, size Vista laptop we have .\\n38

the EEE in place of my laptop because of its portability and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops .\\n43

to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .\\n49

                         One of the things that I found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .\\n50

mouse sucks like all mice but usable if a mouse is your idea of a good time .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I'm using it with a Xion 2 fan pad that folds up to about the size of the closed netbook and runs off a USB port .\\n52

text at this size .\\n53

                                                                                                                                              The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The keyboard is excellent and even though only 92% the size of a full size keyboard, feels like the big one .\\n56

                                          The overall size is just perfect for what I wanted .\\n57

                         The keyboard is just the right size .\\n58

                                          Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n60

seems as though this is due to the small size of the unit, it doesn't have enough room to dissipate the heat .\\n63

                                         just right for the size of my hands .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                           Because of its size and ease of travel ,  pretty soon this became an important part of my wife's professional life and she was using it for work, business discussions, document development etc .\\n65

fit's the bill .\\n66

                                                                                                                                                                                           Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .\\n68

size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :\\n70

issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .\\n71                                                                                                                                             I was also worried that it's small size would equate to something delicate, but I am rough on my electronics, and the ASUS has handled a few rough tousles with textbooks in a bag slung into my car seat without any problems .\\n72

it for .\\n73                                                                                                                                         As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .\\n74

done quickly, I would pay the extra money to go full, sized, even if it's slower .\\n77

                                                  Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite

the above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very

                                                 It doesn't take long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .\\n34

But unlike my previous Garmin, the satellite acquisition is very fast, and recalculation when I deviate from the stated route is almost immediate .\\n36

                I have noticed no problems with this unit's ability to detect satellites .\\n39                                                                                                                         It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  When powered up initially it does a one, time search for satellites .\\n41

it found the satellites very quickly .\\n42

there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46

again start reading a book .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everyone looking into the Kindle has probably heard about the font smoothing contrast issue which is exacerbated by the bright whiteness of the unit's housing .\\n55                                                                                                            However, just last night, I ran across a couple of user fixes for the font smoothing problem, and I've already put a  skin  on mine so that the contrast between the ePaper display's gray background and the  frame's  white is no longer an issue .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                      I have a bit of macular degeneration, and when reading the Kindle, for some reason, that little blurry spot does not show up, and this is at a small font .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Kindle 2 is lightweight, easy to hold, easy to read, and I love the fact that I can change the size of the font, depending on my situation .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I am in my 50's and the reading vision isn't great so changing the font is a blessing .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The interface is a bit like reading newsprint, though you can change the font size to 6 or 8 different settings .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It is so much easier to read than a paper page and you can adjust the font size as needed .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         it's just like reading a paper book, but BETTER because you can increase the font size !\\n62

                                                             The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

                                                                                                                  I needed a comfortable commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29

stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                                                           I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet interior .\\n48                                                                                                                                                          Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

                                                                                             I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound

             I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82

                            The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86

the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into

                                                The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93

road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

              the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104

                 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature,

                                                          The car is VERY comfortable and the air conditioning is perfect for the heat here in Arizona .\\n110

cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !\\n53

                                                                                                                              It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage has been improving and is now consistently 29 hwy 22 city .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                       Very peppy engine great fuel mileage 28, 30 combined .\\n88                                                                                                                                                                            I am not known to drive slowly so I am pleased with the mileage .\\n89                                                                                                         We bought this car with the expectations of getting a car that feels good with my

so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

                Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n57

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n60

the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

                                            Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

                           There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67

the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

                  The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

                                                The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

             There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22                                                                                                                                                       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

in local establishments .\\n25

                                                                                                                                                                    Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n27

service .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                              There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29

as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30



                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .\\n38

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68

scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69

is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station   .\\n87

      This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS .\\n1

enjoyable desktop experience .\\n2

                                                                                                                                                                  They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n4

.\\n5                                                                                                                                               If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n6                                                                                                                                  After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7

                                                                                                     Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9

                                                         But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .\\n11

                   Also in Windows Explorer, two new features .\\n12

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , then Vista, but if so, none of its features have been impressive enough to have blown me away .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It does have some nice features .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                                 W7 is fast and resource friendly, every hardware device works perfect  , and there's a ton of great features .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Runs well, but no stand out new features for my usage .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                         Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                              I liked the built, in features of Vista and of course the appearance, but I prefered the stability and speed of XP even with a high, end system .\\n19

mouse gesture to the bottom right of the screen .\\n20

                                                                They're features I don't use .\\n22                                                                                                        Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It's loaded with useful features .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                                                 It has some features that I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Vista has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                             I haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them .\\n29                                                                     I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a

                                                           What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                    The Garmin is loaded with very accurate maps that generally know the roads in even the remotest areas .\\n49                                                        I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n50                                                                                                                                                       My new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up,

                        I had a GPS 10, years ago when I owned a boat that was difficult to use and with very poor accuracy so I had assumed that the road GPS wasn't any better .\\n52
